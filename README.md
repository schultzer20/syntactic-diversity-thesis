# Syntactic Diversity in Literary Translation – Notebooks

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used for my **master's thesis** at the University of Vienna, titled:

**"Syntactic diversity in Machine-Translated and Post-Edited Literary Texts."**

The notebooks include experiments, analyses, and visualizations of syntactic structures in translations from Brazilian Portuguese to German.
